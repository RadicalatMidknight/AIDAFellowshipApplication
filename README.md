Please find in this folder varying samples of my code from the varying projects on my CV.

Note: The .h files and .c files sharing similar names are not written by me, they are provided by my professor. They are included here because they are the include files for the autonomous car project.

The .m file is my Matlab code for the glide estimation algorithm.

Thank you!
